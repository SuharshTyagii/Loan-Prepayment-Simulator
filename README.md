## üöÄ Why Use This Tool?

Understanding how prepayments affect your loan can lead to significant savings. This simulator helps you:

- Visualize how years can be shaved off your loan term with strategic prepayments
- Calculate exact interest savings from different prepayment strategies
- Plan your financial future with interactive "what-if" scenarios
- Make informed decisions about where to allocate extra funds

## üìä How It Works

The simulator uses standard amortization formulas to calculate how your loan balance changes over time. Key inputs include:

1. **Original loan amount**: The principal you initially borrowed
2. **Remaining principal**: Current outstanding balance
3. **Monthly EMI**: Your regular payment amount
4. **Interest rate**: Annual percentage rate
5. **Extra payments**: Both one-time lump sums and recurring additional payments

As you adjust these parameters, the calculator instantly updates the amortization schedule and visualization to show your new payoff trajectory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components
- **Recharts**: For data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and dark/light mode
- **Lucide Icons**: For beautiful, consistent iconography

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

The simulator calculates loan amortization using the standard formula:

For each payment period:
1. Calculate interest: `Interest = Outstanding Balance √ó (Annual Rate √∑ Periods Per Year)`
2. Calculate principal payment: `Principal = Regular Payment + Extra Payment - Interest`
3. Update balance: `New Balance = Previous Balance - Principal Payment`

## üîç Use Cases

- **Home Mortgage Analysis**: See how additional payments can reduce your 30-year mortgage
- **Student Loan Planning**: Develop a strategy to eliminate student debt faster
- **Auto Loan Optimization**: Determine if making extra payments on your car loan makes financial sense
- **Personal Loan Management**: Visualize the quickest path to debt freedom
